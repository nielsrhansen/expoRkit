Expokit is an efficient Fortran implementation for computing the
matrix exponential, or rather, its action on a vector, for large
sparse matrices. This can also be understood as computing the
solution of a system of linear ordinary first order differential
equations. This package provides an R interface to some of the
Fortran subroutines from Expokit.

The Fortran package was developed by Roger B. Sidje, see
\url{http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/expokit/}. Niels Richard Hansen
adapted the package for use with R and wrote the R
interface. Permission to distribute the Expokit source under GPL was
obtained from Roger B. Sidje.
